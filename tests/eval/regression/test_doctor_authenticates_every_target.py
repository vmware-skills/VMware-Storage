"""The doctor must authenticate every configured target, not just the first.

Real-hardware finding, 2026-08-30. The tester configured five targets and put
the wrong password on three of them. `doctor` printed **✓ All checks passed**,
because `_check_auth` logged into `config.default_target` and stopped. The very
next call failed on authentication, and its error message told the user to run
the doctor — the one that had just cleared them.

Four skills in the family shared this; three others (Aria, NSX, VKS) already
iterated. It is the family's most-repeated shape: a pattern fixed in one repo
and left standing in the rest (CLAUDE.md 形态 #7).

One row is kept rather than one per target, matching the neighbouring
connectivity check's format, so the table shape is unchanged — but the row now
names every target and fails if any of them does.
