## v1.8.3 (2026-07-20) — credentials resolve as a pair; documented env vars now exist

### Added — the per-target username can come from the environment

Adapted from [VMware-AIops#33](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-AIops/pull/33) by
@wright-bench, with thanks. The password already resolved from an env var; the
username did not, so a deployment injecting credentials from a secret store
(systemd `EnvironmentFile`, container secrets, a vault sidecar) could externalise
only half of the pair — and a config-file username paired with an env password
from a different account logs in as nobody.

`<PASSWORD-KEY-PREFIX>_USERNAME` now overrides the `username:` in config.yaml,
using that skill's own password-key convention. Absent, config.yaml still wins;
nothing changes for anyone not setting it.

**Resolved on every access, like the password.** The contributed version read the
username once at load time while the password stayed a property, which
reintroduces exactly the split the override exists to prevent: a sidecar rotating
both halves mid-process moves the password and leaves the username behind. A test
pins that both halves resolve at the same moment.

### Fixed — documented credential variables that the code never read

Rolling the above across the family surfaced a separate defect: four skills
documented a password variable their own loader does not look up. An operator
following the documentation exactly — correct file, correct place, correct-looking
name — got "Password not found".

| Skill | Documented | Actually read |
|---|---|---|
| vmware-nsx | `VMWARE_NSX_<TARGET>_PASSWORD` for target `nsx-prod` → `VMWARE_NSX_PROD_PASSWORD` | `VMWARE_NSX_NSX_PROD_PASSWORD` |
| vmware-nsx-security | `VMWARE_<TARGET>_PASSWORD` | `VMWARE_NSX_SECURITY_<TARGET>_PASSWORD` |
| vmware-aria | `VMWARE_<TARGET>_PASSWORD` | `VMWARE_ARIA_<TARGET>_PASSWORD` |
| vmware-vks | `VMWARE_<TARGET>_PASSWORD` | `VMWARE_VKS_<TARGET>_PASSWORD` |
| vmware-avi | three different forms across three files | `<CONTROLLER>_PASSWORD` |

The prefixes genuinely differ per skill, so nothing could be fixed by
standardising a pattern — each repo's docs were corrected against its own code.
The code was left alone: changing a key would break every existing deployment.

`family_smoke.sh` now compares the credential variables named in each repo's docs
against the ones that repo's code builds, so the two cannot drift apart again.

## v1.8.2 (2026-07-20) — the MCP server moves into the package namespace

### Fixed — co-installing two skills broke all but the last one

Every skill shipped its MCP server as a **top-level `mcp_server` package**. Python
has one top-level namespace, so installing any two of them into one environment let
the second overwrite the first — silently, with no error and no warning.

    uv tool install vmware-aiops   ->  49 tools   (correct)
    uv pip  install vmware-aiops   ->  27 tools   (Monitor's read-only server)

vmware-aiops depends on vmware-monitor, so this was not an edge case: **every pip
install hit it**, and the operator got 27 read-only tools where 49 were expected,
with all 35 write tools missing. Docker images, shared MCP hosts and CI runners that
install more than one skill were affected the same way.

The server now lives at `vmware_<skill>/mcp_server/`, a name only this package can
claim. Introduced 2026-02-26; it survived 70 releases because every test ran against
a single package in its own repo, where the local directory shadows site-packages —
the conflict was invisible by construction.

**Migration.** Console scripts are unchanged: `vmware-<skill>` and
`vmware-<skill>-mcp` work exactly as before, as does `"command": "vmware-<skill>",
"args": ["mcp"]` in an MCP client config. Only a direct `python -m mcp_server`
breaks; use `python -m vmware_<skill>.mcp_server`.

### Added — `references/agent-guardrails.md` in every skill

The operating rules for local and small models (Llama 3.3 70B, Qwen, Mistral via
Goose / Ollama / OpenShift AI) existed in two skills. They now ship in all 13, each
with its own tool counts and failure modes, and are linked from every SKILL.md.

## v1.8.1 (2026-07-19) — read-only mode reaches the surfaces that teach it

v1.8.0 put read-only mode in the code and documented it in the README only.
Every other layer was empty, and each serves a different reader: SKILL.md is what
the agent loads, setup-guide is what an operator reads while configuring, `doctor`
is where they verify it took. The gap had two concrete costs.

An agent read SKILL.md, called a write tool the gate had withheld, and got nothing
back — with no way to learn that the absence was a deliberate lockdown rather than
a fault. It reads as a broken tool, so the model retries or hunts for a workaround.

An operator who set the switch had no way to confirm it. The only signal was a line
in the MCP server's start-up log.

### Added — the feature is now documented where each reader looks

- **SKILL.md** — a short section telling the agent that a missing write tool is a
  lockdown, not a fault: name the blocked operation, do not retry, do not route
  around it.
- **references/setup-guide.md** — the operator's view: how to enable it, the
  precedence chain, and how to verify.
- **references/capabilities.md** — which tools the gate withholds.

### Added — `doctor` reports the read-only state

`vmware-storage doctor` now shows whether read-only mode is on, **which** of the three
switches decided it, and the value as written. A typo'd value (`ture`) is called
out as a typo rather than reported as a confident ON — it resolves to on, which is
fail-closed but almost never what was meant.

The resolution runs through `vmware_policy.read_only_status()` rather than a local
copy of the precedence chain: a doctor that disagrees with the gate it reports on is
worse than no doctor. Requires `vmware-policy>=1.8.1`.

## v1.8.0 (2026-07-18) — read-only mode, working policy defaults, declared environments

Family release driven by [VMware-AIops#31](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-AIops/issues/31),
where an operator running Llama 3.3 70B (Goose / OpenShift AI, on-prem H100) had to
hand-write 17 prompt guardrails to make tool calling reliable. A prompt is advisory — a
model can ignore it. Every guardrail that could move into the harness has.

### Added
- **Read-only mode.** Set `VMWARE_READ_ONLY=true` (or `VMWARE_<SKILL>_READ_ONLY`, or
  `read_only: true` in config.yaml) and every write tool is removed from the MCP registry
  at start-up. `list_tools()` never offers them, so the model cannot call what it cannot
  see. **Off by default** — nothing changes unless you turn it on. Fail-closed: if the
  mode is requested but cannot be guaranteed, the server refuses to start rather than
  running open.
- **`environment:` on each config target**, declaring which environment it is
  (production / staging / lab). Policy rules scope by this value.

### Added — list results now state whether they are complete

Every `[READ]` list tool returns the family envelope instead of a bare array:

    {"items": [...], "returned": 50, "limit": 50, "total": 213,
     "truncated": true, "hint": "Showing 50 of 213. Raise limit or narrow the query..."}

This closes the reported failure where long responses were summarised as "no data
returned": a bare list gives a model no way to tell a complete answer from page one, so
it guessed. `truncated: false` now positively states completeness — including when
`items` is empty, which means "checked, found none", not "the call failed".

- **4 tool(s) converted** across ops, MCP and CLI. All four report a real `total` (PropertyCollector walk, browse task, and the in-memory
  registry filter are each complete enumerations).

### Changed — migration, read this
- **Approval tiers now actually run.** They shipped in v1.6.0 but the engine only ever
  read `~/.vmware/rules.yaml`, and a fresh install has no such file — so every deny rule,
  maintenance window and approval tier had been inert on every install that never
  hand-authored one. A packaged baseline now loads when you have written no rules of your
  own. Writes at medium risk and above are stamped with their tier in the audit log;
  irreversible work and guest execution against a target declared `production` require a
  named approver via `VMWARE_AUDIT_APPROVED_BY`.
- **`environment:` will become required for writes.** Today a state-changing operation
  against a target that declares none still runs and logs a warning. **The next major
  release refuses it.** Declare it now and that upgrade is a no-op:

      targets:
        prod-vc01:
          host: vc01.corp.local
          environment: production

  Read-only operations are never affected, in this release or the next. Check what applies
  to your targets before upgrading: `vmware-audit policy --operation vm_delete --env <env>`.

### Fixed
- **Policy glob patterns with a leading wildcard silently matched nothing.** A rule written
  `operations: ["*_delete"]` parsed fine, read correctly, and never fired — only a trailing
  `*` was honoured. Now full glob matching, for operations and environments alike.
- Config-path overrides (`VMWARE_<SKILL>_CONFIG`) are honoured when reading `read_only`
  and `environment`, so a setting in a custom config file is no longer silently ignored.

### Notes
- Requires `vmware-policy>=1.8.0`; publish that package first.
- `vmware-audit policy` reports which rules are in force and where they came from —
  including the case where your rules file exists but failed to parse, which previously
  looked identical to "policy is working".

## v1.7.7 (2026-07-17) — session-probe None-shape fix + mcp 1.28.1

Family fix pack — no new tools, no schema changes.

### Fixed
- **A dead cached session could be returned as live** (family fix, external
  fork report VMware-AIops PR #32). An expired token can make
  `sessionManager.currentSession` return `None` without raising, and the
  raise-only liveness probe treated that dead session as alive. The probe now
  checks `currentSession is not None`; the exception path (already correct
  here) is unified on the family-standard bare `except Exception`. Three
  regression tests pin the probe shapes (raise → evict + reconnect, None →
  evict + reconnect, live → cache reuse).

### Security
- Lockfile bumps `mcp` to **1.28.1**, clearing three GHSA HIGH advisories
  against the MCP Python SDK (WebSocket Host/Origin validation, HTTP
  transport principal verification, experimental task-handler cross-client
  access). stdio-only servers are not directly exposed, and installs resolve
  `mcp` fresh from PyPI — this mainly matters for from-source checkouts.

## v1.7.5 (2026-07-13) — family version alignment (no code change)

Version-alignment release only; no functional change since v1.7.4.

## v1.7.4 (2026-07-13) — family version alignment

## v1.7.3 (2026-07-03) — family version alignment

## v1.7.2 (2026-07-02) — datastore/host inventory scale (issue #31 port)

### Fixed
- **Datastore & host inventory at scale.** `list_datastores` (the most-called
  read path, backing the datastore browser and iSCSI/vSAN hints), `list_hosts`,
  and the `find_*_by_name` helpers read lazy `.summary` / `.name` / `len(ds.vm)`
  per object — a separate SOAP round-trip each, so large estates (thousands of
  datastores/hosts) timed out. Ported the `PropertyCollector.RetrievePropertiesEx`
  batching from the AIops issue-#31 fix. Output shape unchanged (`vm_count` stays
  opt-in). This also removes the timeout that `vmware-harden` scans inherited
  through `list_datastores`.

## v1.7.1 (2026-07-02) — family version alignment

No code changes. Version bump to stay aligned with the v1.7.1 family release
(VMware-AIops + VMware-Monitor large-inventory scale fix — PropertyCollector
batching to stop per-object lazy SOAP round-trips, GitHub issue #31).

## v1.7.0 (2026-06-27) — guided onboarding + teaching auth errors

### Added
- **`vmware-storage init` — interactive first-run setup wizard.** Prompts for host /
  username / password and writes `config.yaml` + `.env` for you. The password is
  stored grep-safe (`b64:`, never plaintext on disk) and `.env` is locked to
  0600, then the connection is verified. Replaces the manual "mkdir + cp
  config.example.yaml + edit YAML + chmod 600" dance.

### Changed
- `doctor` now points to `vmware-storage init` when config/credentials are missing
  (previously suggested a command that did not exist), keeping the manual steps
  as a fallback.
- Authentication and TLS failures now print a teaching message naming the exact
  file and env var to fix (`~/.vmware-storage/.env` password var, `config.yaml`
  username) plus a `verify_ssl: false` hint for self-signed labs.

## v1.6.1 (2026-06-24)

### Added
- **`.env` passwords are auto-obfuscated to a grep-safe `b64:` form** on first
  load and decoded transparently at runtime — plaintext no longer sits in
  `~/.<skill>/.env` for a casual `grep` to find. Values are read/written through
  python-dotenv's own parser, so the stored secret never drifts from the
  configured one (handles quotes, inline comments, trailing whitespace, and a
  password that literally starts with `b64:`). **Obfuscation, not encryption** —
  for real at-rest secrecy, inject the password from a secret manager instead of
  storing `.env`. New regression suite (10 cases) covers dotenv parity, the
  `b64:`-prefixed edge case, idempotency, and 0600 preservation.

## v1.6.0 (2026-06-22) — trust architecture: undo tokens

### Added
- **Undo-token recording** (vmware-policy 1.6.0): `storage_iscsi_add_target`↔`storage_iscsi_remove_target`.
- Inherits harness budget guard, audit accountability fields, and graduated risk tiers.

### Changed
- Requires **vmware-policy >= 1.6.0**.

## v1.5.39 (2026-06-22) — datastore browse: honest timeout

### Fixed
- **Datastore browse timeout is honest and actionable.** `browse_datastore` waited 120s then raised a
  bare `TimeoutError` on a large/busy datastore (and `scan_images` browses once per image pattern, so the
  budget compounded). Bumped to 300s, and the timeout message now tells the caller to narrow the search
  (sub-path + specific pattern) instead of retrying the same broad browse — the same agent token-burn
  class fixed in AIops snapshot-delete this release. Family sweep of the sync-wait-raises-on-timeout
  pattern (踩坑 #21): VKS/NSX/NSX-Security/Aria/AVI were already safe (fire-and-forget or graceful poll).

## v1.5.38 (2026-06-12) — release alignment

No functional changes — version bumped to keep the VMware skill family aligned at v1.5.38.

## v1.5.37 (2026-06-12) — backlog: faster datastore listing, iSCSI race, ops tests

### Fixed
- `list_datastores` no longer does a per-datastore `ds.vm` round-trip on the default (busiest) path;
  `vm_count` is now opt-in. (#8)
- `enable_software_iscsi` polls for the HBA to materialize before returning success, fixing a race where
  an immediate `add_target` hit "Software iSCSI is not enabled". (#10)

### Added
- Behavioral (mocked-pyVmomi) unit tests for `iscsi_config`, `vsan`, and `datastore_browser`. (#9)

## v1.5.36 (2026-06-12) — OVA scanning fix + destructive-op gating

### Fixed
- **OVA/OVF discovery returned nothing** — the datastore-browser query list excluded generic files;
  `scan-images` and `browse` now surface `.ova`/`.ovf` (added the generic FileQuery).
- **iSCSI remove-target now hits the confirmation gate via MCP** — it was `risk_level=medium`, below
  the policy gate; raised to `high`, and the four MCP write tools gained `dry_run` preview.
- **Audit-write failure no longer flips a successful write to a reported failure** (degrades to stderr).
- `get_vsan_capacity` returns an explicit message instead of healthy-looking zeros when the vSAN
  datastore isn't found; not-found errors include name suggestions; CLI teaching-error decorator.

### Changed
- SKILL.md tool split corrected to **7 read / 4 write** (was mislabeled 6R/5W).

## v1.5.35 (2026-06-10) — security hardening: safe errors, datastore path guard

### Fixed
- **MCP tools route errors through `_safe_error()`** (no raw exception text to the agent).
- **Datastore browse path** rejects `..`, absolute paths, and null bytes.
- **Image registry** written 0600; **audit** dir 0700 / log 0600.

This release aligns the whole family back to a single version (1.5.35); vmware-policy and vmware-pilot return to the shared number after sitting at 1.5.22.

## v1.5.32 (2026-06-08) — Audit-clean confirmation + hardened test suite

The 2026-06-08 family-wide pyVmomi introspection audit verified every iSCSI
and vSAN property chain and method in this codebase against SDK metadata —
no findings (the only skill in the family to pass clean).

### Tests
- vim-attribute conformance regression added (prevents future invented
  pyVmomi names — the failure mode found in sibling skills).
- Safety test repointed at the CLI commands that own the double-confirm
  guards (was asserting the wrong layer and failing permanently).

## v1.5.30 (2026-06-07) — Tool description quality (Glama TDQS)

### Improved
- Rewrote MCP tool descriptions flagged by Glama's Tool Description Quality Score review:
  per-parameter semantics (format, defaults, valid values), return-field documentation,
  sibling-tool routing guidance, and behavioral transparency (side effects, audit logging,
  async semantics). Corrected descriptions that overstated or misstated actual behavior.
- No functional changes; descriptions only.

## v1.5.29 (2026-05-29) — Pattern Library PoC Documentation

### Documentation
- README.md / README-CN.md: new "Auto-Remediation Patterns (PoC)" section pointing at `patterns/iscsi-target-stale-rescan.yaml` (framed as schema reference design, runtime not yet wired).
- SKILL.md: safety bullet referencing `patterns/` library with `risk:low + reversible:true + repeatable:true` classification.
- capabilities.md: L5 row links the PoC YAML with scan target, action, and risk classification; new "Runtime Requirements" table with Python 3.10+ minimum (v1.5.27).

### No code changes
Documentation-only release.

## v1.5.28 (2026-05-20)

**Fix `subclass() arg 1 must be a class` in goose/old mcp environments** —
v1.5.25–1.5.27 replaced `X | None` with `Optional[X]` but kept
`from __future__ import annotations` at the top of `mcp_server/server.py`.
Under mcp 1.10–1.13 (which Goose and some sandboxes pin), `Tool.from_function`
calls `issubclass(param.annotation, Context)` without resolving forward refs,
so string annotations crash the entire server load. Removed
`from __future__ import annotations` from `mcp_server/server.py` so annotations
are real classes; verified all tools load under mcp 1.10 and 1.14.

Traceback location: `mcp/server/fastmcp/tools/base.py:67`. CLAUDE.md 踩坑 #33
updated. family_smoke.sh Check 4b now installs `mcp==1.10.0` to catch this
regression class.

## v1.5.27 (2026-05-20)

**Loosen Python requirement: now supports Python >= 3.10** — v1.5.25/26 fixed
the PEP 604 root cause in MCP tool signatures (Optional[X] instead of X | None),
but kept `requires-python = ">=3.11"` and a 3.11 hard guard in `mcp_cmd`. Both
relaxed to 3.10 so users on Python 3.10 (e.g. Goose default sandbox, Ubuntu
22.04 system python) can install and run directly without a Python upgrade.

- `pyproject.toml`: `requires-python = ">=3.10"` (was `>=3.11`; VMware-VKS
  was `>=3.12`, now also `>=3.10` for family alignment).
- `<pkg>/cli.py` `mcp_cmd()`: version guard now triggers on `< (3, 10)`.
- Behavior on Python 3.10 matches 3.11/3.12 — the Optional[X] fix from v1.5.25
  is what actually enables this; this release just stops blocking installs.

---

## v1.5.26

**Family-wide MCP server fix — Python 3.10 compatibility (踩坑 #33)** — `vmware-storage mcp`
crashed at decorator time on Python 3.10 with `subclass() arg 1 must be a class`.
Root cause: `mcp_server/server.py` used PEP 604 `X | None` in tool signatures
plus `from __future__ import annotations`; on Python 3.10 + older mcp/pydantic
combos, `typing.get_type_hints()` evaluates `"str | None"` to a
`types.UnionType` instance, which FastMCP/Pydantic then feeds to `issubclass()`.
Reported by a goose user (qwen3.6:27, Python 3.10).

- `mcp_server/server.py`: all `X | None` → `Optional[X]`; ops layer untouched.
- `<pkg>/cli.py` `mcp_cmd()`: hard guard — exits with installation fix command
  if Python < 3.11 (defense in depth, our actual lower bound).
- `pyproject.toml`: `mcp[cli]>=1.10,<2.0` (was `>=1.0`) so uv doesn't pick
  an ancient version that has the same issubclass bug.

**Tooling — family smoke gains MCP schema-build check** — `scripts/family_smoke.sh`
new Check 4b runs `asyncio.run(mcp.list_tools())` per skill, forcing FastMCP to
build Pydantic models for every declared tool. Supports both module-level `mcp`
and `build_server()` factory patterns.

**Docs — CLAUDE.md gains 踩坑 #33 (PEP 604 / Python 3.10) and #34 (CLI/MCP exposure parity).**

---

## v1.5.24 (2026-05-19)

**Family version alignment** — no code changes in this skill. Bumped together
with VMware-AIops and VMware-VKS, which received a pyVmomi 8.x `ManagedObject`
setattr fix (踩坑 #32). `family_smoke.sh` now enforces the no-setattr rule
across all 9 skills.

## v1.5.23 (2026-05-19)

**VCF 9.0 / 9.1 compatibility declared** — family-wide docs sync.

- **docs:** README + `references/setup-guide.md` version-compatibility tables now list vSphere 9.0 / 9.1 as ✅ Full. vSAN Management SDK (bundled in pyVmomi 8.0.3+) continues to work against vSphere 9. Note: vSAN ESA full feature coverage in VCF 9 may require future SDK updates.
- **docs:** Added `Official Broadcom References` pointer to [VCF Python SDK](https://developer.broadcom.com/sdks) and [vSAN Management API docs](https://developer.broadcom.com/xapis).
- **align:** Family v1.5.23 — all 9 skills tracking VCF 9.0 / 9.1 compatibility declaration.

## v1.5.22 (2026-05-08)

**Family alignment** — no source changes in this skill.

- **align:** Tracks v1.5.22 family bump driven by Smithery onboarding for vmware-avi / vmware-harden / vmware-pilot.

## v1.5.21 (2026-05-08)

**Family alignment** — no source changes in this skill.

- **deps:** Bumped `python-multipart` 0.0.26 → 0.0.27 (transitive, fixes GHSA HIGH DoS via unbounded multipart headers).
- **align:** Tracks v1.5.21 family bump driven by vmware-monitor folder_path feature (community PR #11).

## v1.5.20 (2026-05-08)

**Family alignment** — no source changes in this skill.

- **align:** Tracks v1.5.20 family bump driven by vmware-nsx-security and vmware-aria PyPI README `mcp-name:` ownership marker fix required by MCP Registry validation. Other 7 skills already had the marker; this release re-publishes them to keep the family version aligned per CLAUDE.md policy.
- **registry:** All 9 skills now registered on registry.modelcontextprotocol.io as `isLatest=true`.

## v1.5.19 (2026-05-06)

**Family alignment** — no source changes in this skill.

- **build:** Bumped `requires-python` from `>=3.10` to `>=3.11` (regression eval uses `tomllib`).
- **smoke:** Family `scripts/family_smoke.sh` adds Check 3b — recursive `--help` on every subcommand to surface broken lazy imports (yjs review 2026-05-06; 踩坑 #27).
- **align:** Tracks v1.5.19 fixes in vmware-nsx (CRITICAL CLI imports), vmware-vks (ApiClient leak), vmware-harden (Twin indexes + LEFT JOIN), vmware-policy (approval gate + singleton lock).

## v1.5.18 (2026-05-02)

**Family alignment + tooling normalization** — no source changes in this skill.

- **dev:** Migrated `[project.optional-dependencies] dev` → `[dependency-groups] dev` (PEP 735) so `uv sync --group dev` works uniformly across the family. Canonical set: `pytest>=8.0,<10.0`, `pytest-cov`, `ruff`.
- **test:** New `tests/eval/regression/test_release_blockers.py` (5 evals) catches the v1.5.x release blockers — missing `mcp_server` in wheel, AST-detected unimported runtime names, Typer app load failure, module import errors. Run via `pytest tests/eval/regression/`.
- **align:** Family version bump to v1.5.18.

## v1.5.17 (2026-05-01)

**Family alignment** — no source changes in this skill.

This release tracks vmware-pilot v1.5.17 (new `investigate_alert` template + `review_workflow` MCP tool + `parallel_group` step type) and vmware-policy v1.5.17 (L5 pattern matcher integrated into `@vmware_tool`). Both work with the existing skill MCP surface unchanged.

- **align:** Family version bump to v1.5.17.

## v1.5.16 (2026-04-30)

**Enterprise Harness Engineering alignment** — adapted from the Linkloud × addxai framework articles ([part 1](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hz4W7ILHJ1yz_pG0Z1xP-A), [part 2](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/F3qYbyB3S8oIqx-Y4BrWNQ)).

- **feat (PoC):** New `patterns/` directory with first L5 auto-remediation candidate `iscsi-target-stale-rescan.yaml` — iSCSI HBA rescan as repeatable, low-risk, idempotent operation. Schema and lifecycle docs in companion vmware-policy. Runtime integration tracked separately.
- **docs:** "Automation Level Reference" section in `references/capabilities.md` — every tool tagged L1-L5 per the EHE framework.
- **docs:** Common Workflows in `SKILL.md` rewritten with pre-flight judgment for iSCSI setup, image scan, and vSAN health.
- **align:** Family version bump to v1.5.16.

## v1.5.15 (2026-04-29)

**UX improvements from real user feedback**

- **feat:** New top-level CLI subcommand `vmware-storage mcp` starts the MCP server. Single command, single binary on PATH after `uv tool install vmware-storage` — no more `uvx --from`, no PyPI re-resolve, no TLS-proxy issues.
- **feat:** Default `verify_ssl: true` on new targets (was `false`). Self-signed cert environments must now opt in explicitly with `verify_ssl: false` in `config.yaml`.
- **docs:** README, SKILL.md, setup-guide.md, and `examples/mcp-configs/*.json` switched to `command: "vmware-storage"`, `args: ["mcp"]`. uvx form moved to fallback with TLS-proxy troubleshooting note.
- **compat:** Legacy `vmware-storage-mcp` console script kept — existing user configs continue to work.

## v1.5.14 (2026-04-21)

**Bug fixes from code review by @yjs-2026 (follow-up)**

- **fix(P0):** `__init__.py` — version synced to match pyproject.toml (was stuck at 1.5.12)
- **fix(security):** `vsan.py` — log message now uses `sanitize(host.name)` to prevent prompt injection via log output

## v1.5.13 (2026-04-21)

**Bug fixes from code review 2026-04-20**

- **fix:** `vsan.py` — `overall_health` now returns `"unknown"` instead of hardcoded `"green"` when VsanVcClusterHealthSystem is not available; removed dead code `_get_vsan_cluster_system`
- **fix(security):** `inventory.py` — `list_hosts` now sanitizes `host.name` via `vmware_policy.sanitize()` to prevent prompt injection (consistent with `list_datastores`)

## v1.5.12 (2026-04-17)

- Align with VMware skill family v1.5.12 (security & bug fixes from code review by @yjs-2026)

## v1.5.11 (2026-04-17)

## v1.5.10 (2026-04-16)

- Security: bump python-multipart 0.0.22→0.0.26 (DoS via large multipart preamble/epilogue)
- Align with VMware skill family v1.5.10

## v1.5.8 (2026-04-15)

- Align with VMware skill family v1.5.8 (NSX/AVI/Aria/AIops bug fixes)

## v1.5.7 (2026-04-15)

- Align with VMware skill family v1.5.7 (Pilot `__from_step_N__` fix + VKS SSL/timeout fix)

## v1.5.6 (2026-04-15)

- Security: bump pytest 9.0.2→9.0.3 (CVE-2025-71176, insecure tmpdir handling)

## v1.5.0 (2026-04-12)

### Anthropic Best Practices Integration

- **[READ]/[WRITE] tool prefixes**: All MCP tool descriptions now start with [READ] or [WRITE] to clearly indicate operation type
- **Read/write split counts**: SKILL.md MCP Tools section header shows exact read vs write tool counts
- **Negative routing**: Description frontmatter includes "Do NOT use when..." clause to prevent misrouting
- **Broadcom author attestation**: README.md, README-CN.md, and pyproject.toml include VMware by Broadcom author identity (wei-wz.zhou@broadcom.com) to resolve Snyk E005 brand warnings

### Storage-specific

- **Workflow failure branches**: Datastore and vSAN workflows include error handling steps

## v1.4.9 (2026-04-11)

- Fix: require explicit VMware/vSphere context in skill routing triggers (prevent false triggers on generic "clone", "deploy", "alarms" etc.)
- Fix: clarify vmware-policy compatibility field (Python transitive dep, not a required standalone binary)

## v1.4.8 (2026-04-09)

- Security: bump cryptography 46.0.6→46.0.7 (CVE-2026-39892, buffer overflow)
- Security: bump urllib3 2.3.0→2.6.3 (multiple CVEs) [VMware-VKS]
- Security: bump requests 2.32.5→2.33.0 (medium CVE) [VMware-VKS]

## v1.4.7 (2026-04-08)

- Fix: align openclaw metadata with actual runtime requirements
- Fix: standardize audit log path to ~/.vmware/audit.db across all docs
- Fix: update credential env var docs to correct VMWARE_<TARGET>_PASSWORD convention
- Fix: declare .env config and vmware-policy optional dependency in metadata

# Release Notes

## v1.4.0 — 2026-03-29

### Architecture: Unified Audit & Policy

- **vmware-policy integration**: All MCP tools now wrapped with `@vmware_tool` decorator
- **Unified audit logging**: Operations logged to `~/.vmware/audit.db` (SQLite WAL), replacing per-skill JSON Lines logs
- **Policy enforcement**: `check_allowed()` with rules.yaml, maintenance windows, risk-level gating
- **Sanitize consolidation**: Replaced local `_sanitize()` with shared `vmware_policy.sanitize()`
- **Risk classification**: Each tool tagged with risk_level (low/medium/high) for confirmation gating
- **Agent detection**: Audit logs identify calling agent (Claude/Codex/local)
- **New family members**: vmware-policy (audit/policy infrastructure) + vmware-pilot (workflow orchestration)
